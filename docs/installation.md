# Installation

## Requirements

canopy orchestrates AI agent tools — it doesn't ship one. You need at
least one supported **platform installed and authenticated** first (a
terminal AI CLI like `claude`/`codex`/`gemini`, or an editor that ships
one, like Cursor/Antigravity/Qoder). See the
[Requirements section in the README](../README.md#requirements) for the
full platform list and how to check a platform is usable.

## Quick install

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniverLab/harness-canopy/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

## Via cargo

```bash
cargo install harness-canopy
```

The crate is `harness-canopy`; the installed binary is **`canopy`**.
Available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/harness-canopy).

## From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UniverLab/harness-canopy.git
cd harness-canopy
cargo build --release
# Binary at target/release/canopy
```

## First-time setup

```bash
canopy setup
```

The interactive wizard detects installed AI CLI platforms from a
GitHub-hosted registry, configures binary paths, model flags, headless
modes, environment variables and temperature units, and generates
`~/.canopy/config.toml`. Running `canopy` with no arguments triggers
setup automatically if it has never run.

If no supported platform is on `PATH`, setup is meant to say so, list
what it supports, and finish with zero platforms configured. It currently
doesn't reach that message — see
[Requirements: If no platform is installed](../README.md#if-no-platform-is-installed)
in the README for the verified failure and where it comes from.

## Auto-update

The daemon checks GitHub releases for new stable versions every 24 hours,
downloads the platform-specific binary (linux-musl, macos-darwin;
x86_64/aarch64) and atomically replaces the running executable.

## Running as a service

```bash
canopy daemon install-service     # register with systemd/launchd
canopy daemon uninstall-service
```

## Data directory

All state lives under `~/.canopy/`:

| Data | Location | Format |
|------|----------|--------|
| Structured data | `~/.canopy/background_agents.db` | SQLite (WAL mode) |
| Vector embeddings | `~/.canopy/rag/vectors.lancedb` | LanceDB |
| Seed identities | `~/.canopy/seeds/<id>/identity.toml` | TOML |
| Terminal history | `~/.canopy/terminals/<name>/history.toml` | TOML |
| Configuration | `~/.canopy/config.toml` | TOML |
| Agent logs | `~/.canopy/logs/<id>.log` | Text (5 MB rotation) |
| Daemon log | `~/.canopy/daemon.log` | Text |

Each `[[clis]]` entry in `~/.canopy/config.toml` may also carry the
infra-retry budget for every agent node/member dispatched on that
platform: `infra_retry_limit` (default 2), `infra_crash_max_seconds`
(default 60) and `infra_backoff_seconds` (default 30). More specific
ensemble/member/node overrides win; see docs/graphs.md.

## Health check

```bash
canopy doctor
```

Checks the data directory, database, config, harnesses, RAG status, file
watchers, daemon process, registry connectivity and auto-update health.
For platforms, it confirms each configured binary is present and
executable on `PATH` — it does **not** check that you're logged in. Check
that per platform, e.g. `claude auth status` or `codex login status`.
