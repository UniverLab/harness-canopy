//! Headless liveness probing for configured platforms.
//!
//! `agent_models`/`doctor` answer "does the catalog list this platform" and
//! "is its binary present and its config well-formed" — neither one ever
//! actually asks the harness to speak. A platform can be installed, listed,
//! and configured while every real invocation answers with its own error
//! text and exits 0 (the 2026-08 `mimocode`/`mimo-auto` incident: `Error:
//! Unsupported model mimo-auto` on stdout, `Error: Invalid API Key` on the
//! named ones, exit code 0 both times). This module is the missing "actually
//! run it" step: build the platform's real headless command, spawn it, and
//! judge the *response*, never the exit code alone.
//!
//! ## What counts as "a usable response"
//!
//! Non-empty stdout is the obvious rule and is too weak — `Error: Invalid
//! API Key` is non-empty stdout that exits 0. Instead every probe asks the
//! harness to echo a unique, per-probe token ([`probe_token`]) and the
//! verdict is whether that exact token shows up anywhere in the captured
//! stdout/stderr ([`probe_target`]). Containment rather than an exact match
//! deliberately tolerates a harness that wraps or decorates its output
//! (banners, ANSI, a leading "Assistant:" prefix) — the token is chosen
//! random enough (`CANOPY-PROBE-<uuidv4>`) that a harness's own error text
//! reflecting it back by coincidence is not a realistic failure mode, and an
//! error message that doesn't echo the prompt (`Unsupported model ...`,
//! `Invalid API Key`) correctly fails the check.
