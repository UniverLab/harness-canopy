//! Prompt presets (P1) — file-backed, user-editable prompt text for builtin
//! agent blueprints. Seeded under `~/.canopy/prompts/` at daemon startup
//! (never overwriting an existing file — user edits are sacred) and resolved
//! at agent SPAWN time, so an edit takes effect on the very next run without
//! a recompile.
//!
//! The engine never special-cases a preset name — "implementer"/"reviewer"/
//! "resilience" are seed data here, exactly like `builtin_blueprint_specs()`
//! in `blueprints.rs`. The hardcoded constants below are both the seed
//! content written to disk *and* the fallback used when a preset file goes
//! missing or unreadable, so the two can never drift apart.
