///   harness ran and chose not to report" apart from "the harness never ran",
///   without any config of its own.
/// - When the node opts in with `require_report: true` in its config, an
///   otherwise-passing run (exit 0, real stdout) that never self-reported is
///   downgraded to `Fail` with `failure_kind: "no_report"`. This is the hole
///   `zero_exit_no_output` doesn't cover: codex, copilot and antigravity have
///   all been observed exiting 0 with non-empty stdout — including the

///   refused or unavailable and nothing was actually done. Self-reporting
///   always wins regardless of this flag: this function only ever runs for
///   the *unreported* branch (see the `self_reported_execution` check at
///   this function's call sites), so there is no case here where an explicit
///   `graph_complete_node` verdict could be overridden.
///
